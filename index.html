            <h2>About The Forgiveness Machine</h2>
            <p>The Forgiveness Machine is a small digital space built for heavy hearts.
                Here, you write what’s been hurting you- something you want to forgive, or something you hope to be
                forgiven for. <br>
                When you press Forgive, the words disappear. <br>
                Not because they were unimportant- but because you chose to release them.
                This simple act of writing, sharing, and letting go helps your mind breathe again. <br>
                No judgments. No records. No memories kept.
                Just you, your feelings, and a moment of peace. <br>
                You don’t have to carry everything alone.
                Sometimes, healing starts with one gentle click.</p>
